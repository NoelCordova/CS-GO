1. Choose which version you want, then copy csgo_bananagaming.txt
2. Paste the file inside this folder: 
Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource <--
3. Add "-language bananagaming" in launch options without quotes
4. Restart your game

Not working? Make sure that:
* csgo_bananagaming.txt is placed in the right folder (it needs to be inside the resource folder)
* Launch options spelled correctly, this is an example how it can look in launch options:
-novid -language bananagaming -tickrate 128 -nojoy
* You have eaten a banana

PS. The error code from the console is normal. 
This happens because the game is trying to locate the original values, just ignore it. =)
